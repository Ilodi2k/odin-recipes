    <h3>The perfect Drink for the Holidays!</h3>
    <p>Many of us look forward to celebrations during the holidays, yet it is also a time when some people are more likely to drink beyond their limits than at other times of the year. Some people will suffer adverse consequences that range from fights to falls to traffic crashes. This holiday season, it is particularly important to take measures to protect your own health and that of your loved ones due to the coronavirus pandemic. This includes following the everyday practices recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to reduce the risk of contracting and spreading the coronavirus, as well as following guidelines for holiday celebrations and small gatherings.</p>
